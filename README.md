# TEVEL-2 Flight Software
This repository contains the flight software for the TEVEL-2 program CubeSat developed by Tel Aviv University in collaboration with ISIS - Innovative Solutions In Space.

The flight software is written in C and uses freeRTOS, an open-source real-time operating system. The software is designed to control and manage the CubeSat's onboard subsystems, including communication, power, and data storage.

The following repository contains:
1. Skeleton files for the flight software project - which contain header files only.
2. ISIS Demo code.
3. Documentation - playload documentation from TAU-1.
